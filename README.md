# Amazon Selenium Example

A little crawler example of using Selenium Chrome Driver.

## Getting Started

I'm getting a few questions for once in a while about my approach to using various browser engines and drivers. Actually i'm standing a bit distant to this kind of driver engines because i like my hands to get dirty with much low level, even IP packaging level requests and connections. :)

So here it's my approach.

### Prerequisites

We need a few things in begin;

* A Couple of Amazon ASIN Codes.
* Put them into a txt file or another file that you want to read from codebase.

## Start The Fire

App also opens a little console for monitoring the process with viewed-recieved stats.

### Exporting

* [JazzExcel](https://github.com/erkmenesen/JazzFramework) - I've used my excel helper for handling export process.


## Built With

* [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) - Chrome Driver Engine.
* [OpenXML](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Open-XML-SDK) - JazzExcel requires that.
* [HTMLAgilityPack](https://html-agility-pack.net/) - DOM manipulation and handling.
* [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/tr-tr/dotnet/csharp/) - For obvious reasons.
## Last Words
